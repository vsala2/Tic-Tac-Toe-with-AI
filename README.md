### Tic-Tac-Toe with MiniMax Algorithm

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using MiniMax Algorithm with AI. The game is designed to be user-friendly and optimized for performance. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of MiniMax algorithm in building a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to showcase the implementation of MiniMax algorithm in building a Tic-Tac-Toe game. To achieve this, we have used Python programming language and implemented the MiniMax algorithm to create the AI opponent for the game.

## Libraries and Tools
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- OpenCV
- Random
- Pickle
- Numpy

## Features
The Tic-Tac-Toe game comes with the following features:
- Random symbol assignment
- User-friendly input
- Score calculation and display
- Animated match display
- Turn indication
- Draw handling
- Persistent score storage
- Reset feature
- Quit option

## Winning and Losing Conditions
If either the player or the AI agent wins, an imaginary line will form connecting 3 same symbols (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). The losing condition is if no combination is formed until all the cells in the grid are full.

We have created a user-friendly interface using Python libraries such as random, pickle, cv2, and numpy, to make the game more enjoyable and engaging for the users. 

## Conclusion
This Tic-Tac-Toe game with MiniMax Algorithm is an excellent example of how to implement AI in a game. The project is a great way to learn about MiniMax algorithm and how it can be used to build AI opponents for games. With its user-friendly interface, score tracking and storage, and various features, the game provides an enjoyable gaming experience.
